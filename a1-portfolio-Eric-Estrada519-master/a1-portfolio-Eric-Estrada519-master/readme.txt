--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 1/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

For basic features I introduced images and clickable images. I also added font that is responsive to any screen size we have. I also used googled icons to make a clickable sidebar when the screen is small


(b) CSS features

For CSS, I used a lot of flex-bot to try to make my nav bar as responsive as I possibly could to make sure that it would work on any screen.
Also, I used it to make sure the options would flip into a sidebar for mobile options

(c) Advanced features

The only advance features I believed I think I could say I added was the nav bar that is responsive to any screen and maybe the frame embedded for my resume
Actually another thing is that I made a contact me page using bootstrap and also used bootstrap to make my text and images more responsive

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

This took me about 15 hours due to me having to constantly go back from one to another to explain what was going wrong with my code. It was a lot of fun though


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

    While getting help I used YouTube videos such as how to incorporate a Google embedded sheet as well as a YouTube video explaining how to make a nav bar which I then
    worked on mine, but made it different by adding accents to see what website you are currently on. I didn't use AI on this due to me believing I could do this without it,
    I did use a YouTube video to explain how to make my contact me page and how to make it work using web3form .

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    The only other classmate I talked to was my friend Ivan and all he told me was what bootstrap was about and what it does. He also showed me the website


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

There is nothing special I think we need to run my code. Everything should already be working. My website does work when it is opened through
index from the folder in the IDE Webstream so I believe my code should be working.
